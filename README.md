# seashells
In a recruitment process I was asked to complete a test of my deductive reasoning. Disappointed in the amount of (free) available training material, I developed this script. 

A lot of the recruiters using these tests claim that deductive reasoning is something static (like IQ), so your training shouldn't improve your results. But it's still a fun puzzle :) 

You run it with 'python3 CLI_seashells.py"
